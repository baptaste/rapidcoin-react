# Cryptocurrencies stats tracker V2 (react)

RapidCoin is a website that shows datas of top current cryptocurrencies ordered by market capitalization,
provided by CoinGecko's API.
You can see infos among 100 coins easily (like Bitcoin, Ethereum and more).

The site displays coins in "block" format but if you're visiting on desktop you could switch for a classic table dashboard.
